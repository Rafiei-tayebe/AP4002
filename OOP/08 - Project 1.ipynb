    "- account holders have a **first** and **last** name\n",
    "- accounts have an associated **preferred time zone offset** or UTC offset (e.g. -7 for MST)\n",

    "- but, **deposits** and **withdrawals** can be made (given sufficient funds)\n",
    "    - if a withdrawal is attempted that would result in nagative funds, the transaction should be declined.\n",
    "- a **monthly interest rate** exists and is applicable to all accounts **uniformly**. There should be a method that can be called to calculate the interest on the current balance using the current interest rate, and **add it** to the balance.\n",
    "- each deposit and withdrawal must generate a **confirmation number** composed of:\n",
    "    - the transaction type: `D` for deposit, and `W` for withdrawal, `I` for interest deposit, and `X` for declined (in which case the balance remains unaffected)\n",
    "    - the account number\n",
    "    - the time the transaction was made, using preffered timezone\n",
