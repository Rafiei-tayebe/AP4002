    "1. Consume Less memory: Instance methods are object too, and creating them has a cost. Having a static method avoids that. Let’s assume you have ten employee objects and if you create gather_requirement() as a instance method then Python have to create a ten copies of this method (seperate for each object) which will consume more memeory. On the other hand static method has only one copy per class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To Write Utility functions: Static methods have limited use because they don’t have access to the attributes of an object (instance variables) and class attributes (class variables). However, they can be helpful in utility such as conversion form one type to another. The parameters provided are enough to operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Readabiltity: Seeing the @staticmethod at the top of the method, we know that the method does not depend on the object’s state or the class state."
